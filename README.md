# DaylightSaving-Seizures
Analysis of DST-related seizure incidence in Seizure Tracker data from 2008-2016 with over 1.2 million documented seizures.

There are 2 files now:
  -DSTclean.Rmd is the R Markdown for cleaning (takes a couple days for some of the loops)
  -DSTanalysis.Rmd then loads the cleaned csv files and runs the main analyses
