# DaylightSaving-Seizures
Analysis of DST-related seizure incidence in Seizure Tracker data from 2008-2016 with over 12 million documented seizures.

There are 2 files now:
-DSTclean.Rmd is the R Markdown for cleaning (takes a couple days for some of the loops)
-DSTanalysis.Rmd then loads the cleaned csv files and runs the main analyses
